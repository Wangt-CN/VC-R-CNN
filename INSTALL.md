## Installation

Most of the requirements of this projects are exactly the same as [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark). If you have any problem of your environment, you should check their [issues page](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark/issues) first. Hope you will find the answer.

### Requirements:

- PyTorch 1.0 from a nightly release. It **will not** work with 1.0 nor 1.0.1. Installation instructions can be found in https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
- torchvision from master
- cocoapi
- yacs
- matplotlib
- GCC >= 4.9
- OpenCV
- CUDA >= 9.0


### Step-by-step installation

```bash
# Here we directly provide the instll.bash file for convenient installation. 
# first, make sure that your conda is setup properly with the right environment
# for that, check that `which conda`, `which pip` and `which python` points to the
# right path. From a clean conda env, this is what you need to do

conda create --name vc_rcnn -y
conda activate vc_rcnn

# Then just run:
sh install.sh
```
